'''
We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).
Let's try to understand this with an example.
You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.

Task
Read a given string, change the character at a given index and then print the modified string.

Function Description
Complete the mutate_string function in the editor below.
mutate_string has the following parameters:
string string: the string to change
int position: the index to insert the character at
string character: the character to insert
Returns
- string: the altered string

Input Format
The first line contains a string, string.
The next line contains an integer position, the index location and a string character, separated by a space.
'''

def mutate_string(string, position, character):
    l = list(string)
    l[position] = character
    new_string = ''.join(l)
    return new_string

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    i, c = input().split()
    s_new = mutate_string(s, int(i), c)
    print(s_new)
