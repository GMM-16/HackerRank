/*
In this challenge, you will use logical bitwise operators. All data is stored in its binary representation. The logical operators, and C language, use 1 to represent true and 0 to represent false. The logical operators compare bits in two numbers and return true or false, 0 or 1, for each bit compared.
Bitwise AND operator & The output of bitwise AND is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands is 1. If either bit of an operand is 0, the result of corresponding bit is evaluated to 0. It is denoted by &.
Bitwise OR operator | The output of bitwise OR is 1 if at least one corresponding bit of two operands is 1. It is denoted by |.
Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator ^ The result of bitwise XOR operator is 1 if the corresponding bits of two operands are opposite. It is denoted by âŠ•.

Function Description
Complete the calculate_the_maximum function in the editor below.
calculate_the_maximum has the following parameters:
int n: the highest number to consider
int k: the result of a comparison must be lower than this number to be considered
Prints
Print the maximum values for the and, or and xor comparisons, each on a separate line.

Input Format
The only line contains 2 space-separated integers, n and k.

Constraints
2 <= n <= 10^3
2 <= k <= n
