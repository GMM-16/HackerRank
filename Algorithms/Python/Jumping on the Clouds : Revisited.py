'''
A child is playing a cloud hopping game. In this game, there are sequentially numbered clouds that can be thunderheads or cumulus clouds. The character must jump from cloud to cloud until it reaches the start again.
There is an array of clouds, c and an energy level e = 100. The character starts from c[0] and uses 1 unit of energy to make a jump of size k to cloud c[(i + k) % n]. If it lands on a thundercloud, c[i] = 1, its energy (e) decreases by 2 additional units. The game ends when the character lands back on cloud 0.
Given the values of n, k, and the configuration of the clouds as an array c, determine the final value of e after the game ends.

Function Description
Complete the jumpingOnClouds function in the editor below.
jumpingOnClouds has the following parameter(s):
int c[n]: the cloud types along the path
int k: the length of one jump
Returns
- int: the energy level remaining.

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers, n and k, the number of clouds and the jump distance.
The second line contains n space-separated integers c[i] where 0 <= i < n. Each cloud is described as follows:
If c[i] = 0, then cloud i is a cumulus cloud.
If c[i] = 1, then cloud i is a thunderhead.

Constraints
2 <= n <= 25
1 <= k <= n
n % k = 0
c[i] âˆˆ {0,1}
