 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
The STATION table is described as follows:

TABLE STATION

Field    |    Type

ID       |    NUMBER
CITY     |    VARCHAR2(21)
STATE    |    VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N    |    NUMBER
LONG_W   |    NUMBER

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

SELECT ROUND(ABS(MIN(LAT_N)-MAX(LAT_N))+ABS(MIN(LONG_W)-MAX(LONG_W)),4) FROM STATION
